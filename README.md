# Higher card-game
 Figuring out the probability of 5 consequtive higher cards in a row

The question:
You are dealt one card at a time from the top of the deck.
If you are dealt 5 cards in a row that continue to get higher, you win the jackpot! But if just one card is dealt that is either the same, or lower, you lose :(
so 5 6 9 Q A wins!
but 5 6 Q Q... you lose at the 4th card :(
What is the probability you win?
